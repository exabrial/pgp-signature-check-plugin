# pgp-signature-check-plugin
Maven plugin to automatically check PGP signatures of downloaded artifacts



## Acknowledgements

This entire project was inspired by the amazing work over at https://github.com/s4u/pgpverify-maven-plugin. We borrow one class under the Apache Source License. If you're wondering the difference between the two, this project uses the native gpg on your system. This allows this plugin to handle all corner cases, such as signing using a subkey, ECDSA keys, and much more.
